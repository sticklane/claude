# agentprof evidence — orchestration-skill cost profile (2026-07-04 → 2026-07-11)

Shared evidence base for `drain-wake-cost`, `orchestrator-share-audit`, and
`agent-tier-leaks`. Source: `agentprof claude --days 7` over `~/.claude`
transcripts — 137 sessions, 48,729 API calls, $4,998.94 API-equivalent.
Analysis ran over the canonical samples JSONL
(`agentprof claude --days 7 -o samples.jsonl`); "rewrite" below means a call
whose `cache_write_tokens` exceeded both `cache_read_tokens` and 50k — i.e.
the prompt prefix was not served from cache and the whole context was
re-written at 1.25× input rate.

## Headline measurements

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| Main-line (orchestrator) spend | $2,841 of $4,999 (57%) |
| Whole-prefix cache rewrites | 614 calls, $1,020 (20.4% of total) |
| — of which main-line | $823 (inside workers: only $197) |
| — main-line rewrites after >5m idle gap (cache-TTL expiry) | 268 wakes, $587 |
| — main-line rewrites at <5m gap, context flat/growing (prefix invalidation) | 112 calls, $236 |
| — compaction-shaped rewrites (context shrank >30% at rewrite) | 0 |
| Rewrite size | median 187k tokens, p90 384k, max 671k |
| Heavy-session spend after context first crossed 200k | $1,279 (45% of all main-line spend) |
| Per-call cost growth q1→q4 in top sessions | 2–4× (avg context 100k → 300–600k) |

The TTL-expiry cluster matches drain's awaited-worker shape exactly: the
orchestrator awaits a worker for 5–30 minutes, its prefix falls out of the
5-minute cache window, and the verdict-collection call re-caches the entire
context. At the median rewrite size on opus input rates that is ≈$3.50 per
verdict; at a 40k orchestrator context it would be ≈$0.75.

## Orchestrator vs delegated share per skill

| Skill | main-line $ | delegated $ | orch share |
|---|---|---|---|
| /parallel | 4.54 | 25.83 | 15% |
| /drain | 194 | 186 | 51% |
| /idea | 81 | 34 | 70% |
| /build | 58 | 16 | 78% |
| /breakdown | 142 | 27 | 84% |

Note: /breakdown, /build, and /idea already carry "don't read the codebase
into this session" doctrine — the high share is NOT missing instructions.
Root cause is unmeasured (see orchestrator-share-audit).

Freehand orchestration — turns named "drain…"/"ultracode" running under
`(no skill)` — cost $1,406 across 15,072 calls, ~5× attributed skill:drain,
and contains the worst rewrite-waste sessions.

## Agent-tier economics

| Agent type | total $ | calls | $/call | model mix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| general-purpose | 1,126 | 16,771 | 0.067 | fable $474 / opus $425 / sonnet $113 |
| agentic:implementation-worker | 609 | 10,736 | 0.057 | opus $538 (pinned) |
| agentic:verifier | 187 | 5,028 | 0.037 | sonnet $81 / **fable $74** / opus $31 |
| agentic:critic | 58 | 1,170 | 0.049 | opus $46 |
| agentic:scout | 52 | 8,637 | 0.006 | haiku (pinned) |

Structural pins (scout→haiku, implementation-worker→opus, verifier→sonnet in
`.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter) held wherever they applied. Leaks: $74 of
verifier spend ran on fable despite the sonnet pin, and general-purpose —
the second-largest sink overall — inherits the session's frontier model and
is costlier per call than the opus-pinned implementation-worker.

Bare vs `agentic:`-prefixed agent frames (e.g. `agent:verifier` vs
`agent:agentic:verifier`) both appear; hypothesis: bare = repo-local
`.claude/agents/` in the toolkit dev checkout, prefixed = plugin-served.
