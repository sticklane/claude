# Token discipline

Context is the scarce resource. Every token in the main conversation is
re-sent on every subsequent turn, so pollution compounds. Spend main-context
tokens on decisions; delegate consumption of raw material to subagents.

## Delegation defaults

- **Never read files into main context to "look around."** Use the `scout`
  agent (Haiku, read-only) for any where/how/what-exists question. Fan out
  multiple scouts in parallel for independent questions; you keep the
  conclusions, not the file dumps.
- Read a file directly only when you are about to edit it, and prefer reading
  the relevant slice over the whole file.
- Verification, review, and research that produce lots of intermediate output
  belong in subagents (`verifier`, `critic`, `Explore`) whose transcripts are
  discarded — only their final report costs you anything.

## Model and effort matching

- Mechanical or lookup work → Haiku / `effort: low` (the `scout` default).
- Judgment work (specs, review, tricky implementation) → session model.
- Don't pay frontier-model rates to run `grep`.

## Session hygiene

- One task per session. When a task completes, `/clear` and start the next
  from its task file rather than carrying dead context forward.
- Long-running work should be resumable from artifacts on disk (specs, task
  files, notes in `docs/`), never from conversation memory. If a session is
  getting heavy mid-task, write a handoff file and restart from it.
- Don't re-run searches or re-read files already established this session;
  don't paste large command output back into the conversation — summarize it.

## Cheap before expensive

- Critique the spec before implementing it (a `critic` pass costs ~1% of a
  wrong implementation).
- Make acceptance checks runnable commands, so verification is one cheap
  subagent instead of an interactive debugging spiral.
